# Iterative vs. Direct Solvers for Linear Systems ‚öôÔ∏è  

This project was created as part of *Project Practicum I* at the **Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin (2025)**.  
It investigates **iterative** and **direct** methods for solving large linear systems, focusing on the **Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)** method and comparing it with **LU decomposition**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods
- Finite Difference Discretization of the 2D Poisson Equation  
- Construction of Sparse Matrices and Linear Systems  
- **LU Decomposition** (direct method)  
- **Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)** method  
- Convergence and Error Analysis  
- Spectral Radius Computation

## üìä Results
The experiments show:
- The **SOR method** converges faster for optimal relaxation parameter \( \omega_{\text{opt}} \approx 1.8{-}1.9 \).  
- The **optimal œâ increases** with finer grid sizes \( n \) and approaches 2.  
- For small systems (\( N \leq 10^4 \)), **LU decomposition** remains faster.  
- An **\( h^2 \)** convergence rate was verified for the finite difference discretization.  
- Using an **\( h^4 \)**-dependent stopping criterion \( \varepsilon = h^4 \) yields high accuracy and stable results.
